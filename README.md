# SpaceX - Roadster :rocket:

## Project brief
This was my first exam in school as a front-end development student.
I was tasked with making a microsite for either SpaceX or NASA with a focus on raising awarness on space activity.
Another goal of this project was to use an API (in this case https://docs.spacexdata.com/) and display results in HTML.

## End result
I chose to work with children as a target audience for this project. I wanted to make the content more
reliant on art and vibrant colors. I made some of the art myself (i.e. the Tesla Roadster), while most of it is curated from the web.

The API call displays information about the Tesla Roadsters trip through space, including velocity and current distance from Earth and Mars.
It also displays information on several SpaceX rockets.

This project is a combination of vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.
